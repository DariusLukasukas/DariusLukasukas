### Hi there 👋

I'm Darius Lukasukas, a self-taught developer with a knack for turning ideas into user-friendly and interactive web applications. I have a strong interest in mobile and web application development, back-end development. I love to learn and explore new technologies, and I'm always looking for new challenges to expand my skillset. My goal is to make a positive impact through technology and contribute to the open-source community.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- I'm currently working on a Spotify-like music application that aims to provide users with a seamless and personalized music streaming experience. The project incorporates features such as:
  - A clean and intuitive user interface for easy browsing and navigation through various music genres, playlists, and albums.
  - A powerful search functionality that allows users to effortlessly find their favorite artists, tracks, and albums.
  - Customizable playlists, enabling users to create, edit, and share their own collections of music.
  - A recommendation engine that suggests new songs and artists based on users' listening habits and preferences.
